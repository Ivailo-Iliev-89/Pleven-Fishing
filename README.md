# PlevenFishing Atlas

### A Full-Stack Geospatial Directory for Anglers in Pleven Region, Bulgaria

**PlevenFishing** is a robust web platform that centralizes angling intelligence for the Pleven region.
It bridges the gap between static location data and dynamic user needs through a custom-built filtering system and Google Maps integration.

## Key Technical Features

- Filtering Engine: Leverages Django's ORM to filter locations by criteria (water body, type, fishing methods) using optimized `ManyToMany` queries.
- Relational Data Structure: Link fishing reports (Posts) to specific locations using Django `ForeignKey`.
- Geospatial Integration: Embedded Google Maps API for precise location tracking.
- Secure Configuration: Implemented industry-standard security by decoupling settings from credentials using Environment Variables.
- SEO & UX Focused: Responsive design (Flexbox/Grid) with optimized typography (Google Fonts).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python , Django 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Flexbox and Grid), JavaScript
- **Environment Management**: Python-dotenv for secure credential handling.
- **API**: Google Maps JavaScript API

## Instructions to setup

- ```bash
- git clone https://github.com/ivailoiliev89-netizen/Pleven-Fishing.git
- After installation, the user must log in to /admin and add objects with photos.
- Create a .env file and populate it with your DB credentials (see settings.py for required keys).
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python manage.py migrate
- python manage.py runserver
  
## What I Learned

- API Integration: Gained experience in integrating and customizing third-party services like the Google Maps JavaScript API for real-world applications.
- Querying: Using a Django's `filter()` and `exclude()` methods to handle complex many-to-many relationships in a user-friendly way.
- Environment Security: Learned the importance of securing sensitive data (API keys, DB credentials) using `python-dotenv` to follow industry best practices.
- Data Modeling: Understood how to design a relational schema that connects geographical locations with user-contributed reports and fishing methods.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with a Weather API for real-time fishing conditions.
- Interactive "Catch Map" using Leaflet.js.
